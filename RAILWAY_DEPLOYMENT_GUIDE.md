# ðŸš‚ Railway Deployment Guide for HackRX Application

## âœ… Pre-Deployment Checklist

Your application is now **Railway-ready** with these files created:
- âœ… `Procfile` - Railway process configuration
- âœ… `railway.json` - Railway deployment settings
- âœ… `runtime.txt` - Python version specification
- âœ… `requirements.txt` - Dependencies list
- âœ… Health check endpoint at `/`
- âœ… OpenAI API key configured locally

## ðŸš€ Step-by-Step Railway Deployment

### Step 1: Create Railway Account & Project
1. **Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)**
2. **Sign up/Login** (use GitHub for easy integration)
3. **Click "New Project"**
4. **Choose "Deploy from GitHub repo"**

### Step 2: Connect Your GitHub Repository

**Option A: If you have GitHub repo:**
1. **Select your repository** from the list
2. **Railway will auto-detect** the Python app

**Option B: If no GitHub repo yet:**
1. **Create new GitHub repository:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/crops/Desktop/bajaj
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial HackRX application"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/hackrx-app.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
2. **Then connect to Railway**

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables
1. **In Railway dashboard, go to your project**
2. **Click "Variables" tab**
3. **Add these environment variables:**
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY = sk-proj-H5... (your actual key)
   PORT = 8000 (Railway will override this automatically)
   ```

### Step 4: Deploy Configuration
1. **Railway will automatically detect:**
   - Python application
   - Requirements from `requirements.txt`
   - Start command from `Procfile`

2. **Click "Deploy"**

3. **Wait for deployment** (usually 2-3 minutes)

### Step 5: Get Your Public URL
1. **After successful deployment:**
   - Railway will provide a public URL like: `https://hackrx-app-production.up.railway.app`
2. **Your HackRX endpoint will be:**
   ```
   https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/hackrx/run
   ```

## ðŸ§ª Testing Your Deployed Application

### Test Health Check:
```bash
curl https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/
```

### Test HackRX Endpoint:
```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/hackrx/run" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Accept: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer a2f387310984b739ae7e4accffad70a62e5673145dd05bc749dc913c0e6d0c42" \
     -d '{
    "documents": "https://hackrx.blob.core.windows.net/assets/policy.pdf?sv=2023-01-03&st=2025-07-04T09%3A11%3A24Z&se=2027-07-05T09%3A11%3A00Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=N4a9OU0w0QXO6AOIBiu4bpl7AXvEZogeT%2FjUHNO7HzQ%3D",
    "questions": ["What is the grace period for premium payment?"]
}'
```

## ðŸ“‹ HackRX Platform Submission

### Submission Details:
- **Webhook URL:** `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/hackrx/run`
- **Method:** POST
- **Authentication:** Bearer token (already configured)
- **Content-Type:** application/json

### Submission Notes (Optional):
```

```

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Build Fails:**
   - Check `requirements.txt` has all dependencies
   - Ensure Python version compatibility

2. **App Crashes:**
   - Verify `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in Railway variables
   - Check logs in Railway dashboard

3. **Timeout Issues:**
   - Railway has 10-minute request timeout (should be fine for your app)
   - Your app typically responds in 30 seconds for 10 questions

4. **Memory Issues:**
   - Railway free tier has 512MB RAM limit
   - Your app should work fine within this limit

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Performance on Railway

- **Cold Start:** ~10-15 seconds (first request after idle)
- **Warm Requests:** 2-3 seconds per question
- **Memory Usage:** ~200-300MB
- **Uptime:** 99.9% (Railway is very reliable)
