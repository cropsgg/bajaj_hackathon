# Questions and their corresponding answers

    {
        "question": "How does Newton define 'quantity of motion' and how is it distinct from 'force'?",
        "answer": "Newton defines 'quantity of motion' as the product of a body's mass and velocity (momentum). It differs from 'force', which causes changes in motion."
    },
    {
        "question": "According to Newton, what are the three laws of motion and how do they apply in celestial mechanics?",
        "answer": "Newton's lawsâ€”1) inertia, 2) F=ma, 3) action-reactionâ€”explain celestial mechanics by showing how gravity provides the centripetal force for planetary motion."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does Newton derive Kepler's Second Law (equal areas in equal times) from his laws of motion and gravitation?",
        "answer": "Newton derives Kepler's Second Law by showing that a planet swept equal areas in equal times due to the conservation of angular momentum under a central gravitational force."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does Newton demonstrate that gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses?",
        "answer": "He showed that a force causing elliptical planetary orbits must decrease with the square of the distance, using geometric proofs and planetary data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is Newton's argument for why gravitational force must act on all masses universally?",
        "answer": "Newton argued that all matter exerts gravitational force to maintain observed celestial motions, implying gravity acts universally on all masses."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does Newton explain the perturbation of planetary orbits due to other planets?",
        "answer": "Newton explained orbital perturbations as the result of gravitational interactions between multiple bodies, using approximations and geometric analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "What mathematical tools did Newton use in Principia that were precursors to calculus, and why didn't he use standard calculus notation?",
        "answer": "He used geometric limits and fluxions (his version of calculus), avoiding standard calculus notation due to its lack of formalization at the time."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does Newton use the concept of centripetal force to explain orbital motion?",
        "answer": "Newton showed that centripetal force directed at the center of motion keeps planets in orbit, matching gravitational attraction with orbital velocity."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does Newton handle motion in resisting media, such as air or fluids?",
        "answer": "Newton modeled resisting media by adding drag forces proportional to velocity or velocity squared, showing their effect on slowing motion over time."
    },
    {
        "question": "In what way does Newton's notion of absolute space and time differ from relative motion, and how does it support his laws?",
        "answer": "He proposed absolute space and time as fixed frameworks, independent of objects, to define true motion and validate his laws objectively."
    },
    {
        "question": "Who was the grandfather of Isaac Newton?",
        "answer": "Isaac Newton's paternal grandfather was also named Isaac Newton."
    },
    {
        "question": "Do we know any other descent of Isaac Newton apart from his grandfather?",
        "answer": "Newton had no children or direct descendants; he remained unmarried and had no known lineage beyond his grandparents."
