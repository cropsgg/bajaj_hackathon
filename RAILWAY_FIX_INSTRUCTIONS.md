# 🔧 RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT FIX

## ❌ Issue Identified
The Railway deployment failed because `langchain-community` was missing from `requirements.txt`.

**Error:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'langchain_community'`

## ✅ Fix Applied
I've updated `requirements.txt` to include:
```
langchain-community>=0.0.350
```

## 🚀 Next Steps to Deploy

### Option 1: Auto-Deploy (If GitHub connected)
1. **Push the fix to GitHub** (I've prepared the commit)
2. **Railway will auto-redeploy** from the updated repository
3. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for deployment to complete

### Option 2: Manual Update in Railway
1. **Go to your Railway dashboard**
2. **Click "Redeploy"** or trigger a new deployment
3. **Railway will pick up the updated requirements.txt**

### Option 3: If Push Failed, Manual Upload
1. **Download the updated `requirements.txt`** from your local project
2. **Edit it directly in Railway** (if they have file editor)
3. **Or re-create the GitHub repo** with the updated files
