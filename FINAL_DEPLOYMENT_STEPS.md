## üéØ EXPECTED PERFORMANCE

Your deployed system should:
- ‚úÖ **Cold Start**: ~10-15 seconds (first request after idle)
- ‚úÖ **Warm Requests**: 2-3 seconds per question
- ‚úÖ **Batch Processing**: 10 questions in ~30 seconds
- ‚úÖ **Accuracy**: High precision with explainable responses
- ‚úÖ **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime on Railway

---

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING

### If Deployment Fails:
1. **Check Railway logs** in the dashboard
2. **Verify OPENAI_API_KEY** is set correctly
3. **Ensure your GitHub repo** is public or Railway has access

### If API Returns Errors:
1. **Check Authentication**: Ensure Bearer token is correct
2. **Check OpenAI Credits**: Ensure your OpenAI account has credits
3. **Check Document URLs**: Ensure they're accessible

### If Responses are Slow:
- First request after idle takes longer (cold start)
- Subsequent requests should be fast
